# SHORT DESCRIPTION
Define with ATDD.TestScriptor ATDD test scenarios and convert it into AL code

# LONG DESCRIPTION
The Acceptance Test-Driven Development test scriptor allows the user to define in a managed matter ATDD test scenarios and convert it into a code structure to facilate fast test code development. At this moment this conversion is only implemented for .al

## Optional Subtopics
An ATDD pattern is defined by so called tags:
-    FEATURE: defines what feature(s) the test or collection of test cases is testing
-    SCENARIO: defines for a single test the scenario being teste
-    GIVEN: defines what data setup is needed; a test case can have multiple GIVEN tags when data setup is more complex
-    WHEN: defines the action under test; each test case should have only one WHEN tag
-    THEN: defines the result of the action, or more specifically the verification of the result; if multiple results apply, multiple THEN tags will be needed
